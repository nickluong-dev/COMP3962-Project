# PokeMart Project
This was a class project part of BCIT's Cloud Computing Platforms class (COMP 3962). The goal of this project was to utilize different AWS services, and design a cloud architecture to deploy a simple webapp.

PokeMart is a simple eCommerce store. Users can "buy" Pokemon and add them to a cart. On checkout, Pokemon are written to a database.
